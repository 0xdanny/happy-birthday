          I am not what you might consider a writer. Not in my wildest
          imagination did I ever think I’d hold a pen (albeit figuratively) and
          write about how I feel about someone. Never in my wildest dreams did I
          ever think I’d stay on a phone call with someone for long hours. Never
          in a million years did I suspect that rather my heart would become so
          intertwined with yours – that you would become such an important part
          of my life to the point where my entire world would shift as a result
          of loving you. I honestly never thought any of these as remotely
          possible. So I want to thank you for not only filling a void in my
          heart but also for showing me that life itself has so much more to
          offer and that there is room for change.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          The way I think about you frightens me, and I don’t mean this in the
          sense that I would do anything stupid if I suffered the heartbreak of
          losing you. Rather it’s like I have always prided myself on my
          independence, but now every minute of the day is filled with
          inescapable thoughts of you.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Today’s a great day. You make today a day to look forward to because
          with you, today has more meaning. If there’s a day I’d stay away from
          your presence, it’s definitely not today. Today, you were born, and
          even though I was not present, I’m sure there must have been great
          rejoicing around you. You are a bringer of light and love and you’re
          perfect for me. It’s like a mini-Christmas to me and it kinda sucks
          that it has only 24 hours in it. Until the end of today, I’ll let all
          who cares to hear that life is beautiful with you in it. You’re a big
          influence to my joy and that life without you is one thing I don’t
          want to imagine. There’s no day like today and when I blow, I’d
          suggest it should be a national holiday. It sucks we won’t be together
          today but and one day, we’ll spend your birthday in the most exciting
          way.
          <br />
          <br />

          You are the pepperoni to my pizza, the Bruno Fernandes to my
          Manchester United, the laugh track to my otherwise boring sitcom. When
          you cross my mind, the color yellow comes to mind to match your
          personality. I love you and really, really, really need you. And
          hopefully you feel the same, or else I’d be tempted to write another
          letter. I celebrate you and I’m proud to say you’re mine. My life has
          been beautiful with you in it and there’s a lot to like about you. You
          will live in favour and peace from now on and you’ll only get better.
          I wish you every good thing you wish yourself and every good thing you
          deserve.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>Have a memorable day!</p>
